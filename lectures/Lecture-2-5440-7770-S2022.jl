### Constraint-Based Perspective and Tools
In this lecture, we introduce the underlying ideas of the constraints-based approach to the metabolic design problem in which we seek to maximize a metabolic network's performance (in some sense) subject to physical or economic constraints. In this lecture, we'll focus on reaction networks occurring in cells, but later show how we can adapt these tools to consider cell-free systems.

In particular, we'll discuss:

* Intracellular species material balance equations (in the continuum limit)
* Constraint-Based tools such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
* The stoichiometric matrix and convex network decomposition methods

### Dynamic species material balances in the continuum limit

Let's consider the general case in which we have $\mathcal{R}$ chemical reactions and $\mathcal{M}$ metabolites (chemical species) operating in some well-mixed physical (or logical) control volume $\Omega$. In the general continuum well-mixed limit (we ignore random fluctuations, at least for now), the species mole balance around each chemical species (metabolite) $i$ is given by:

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(C_{i}\beta\right) = \sum_{s=1}^{\mathcal{S}}d_{s}\dot{n}_{s} + \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right)\beta \qquad{i=1,2,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

where $C_{i}$ denotes the concentration (or number density) of species $i$ calculated with respect to a _system basis_ $\beta$. 

The first set of terms on the right-hand side denotes the rate of physical or _logical_ transport (units: mol or number per unit time) of chemical species $i$ into or from control volume $\Omega$, where $d_{s}$ denotes a direction parameter (in = +1, out = -1) for stream $s$. 

The second set of terms describes the rate of chemical reactions that are occurring in the physical or logical control volume $\Omega$. The $\hat{r}_{j}$ terms describe the net rate of production (consumption) per unit $\beta$ of species $i$ by enzyme-catalyzed chemical reaction $j$, while $\sigma_{ij}$ denotes the stoichiometric coefficient relating species $i$ with reaction $j$:

* A stoichiometric coefficient $\sigma_{ij}$ > 0 implies that metabolite $i$ is __produced__ by reaction $j$
* A stoichiometric coefficient $\sigma_{ij}$  = 0 implies that metabolite $i$ is __not connected__ to reaction $j$
* A stoichiometric coefficient $\sigma_{ij}$ < 0 implies that metabolite $i$ is __consumed__ by reaction $j$

##### General intracellular species material balances

Let's use the balance equations above, to develop intracellular material balances governing the concentration of metabolite $i$. In particular, let's expand the accumulation term (chain rule):

$$\frac{d}{dt}\left(C_{i}\beta\right) = \beta\frac{dC_{i}}{dt}+C_{i}\frac{d\beta}{dt}\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

which can be substituted into the general balance equation to give:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \frac{1}{\beta}\left(\sum_{s=1}^{\mathcal{S}}d_{s}\dot{n}_{is}\right) + \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - \frac{C_{i}}{\beta}\frac{d\beta}{dt}\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

When building models of the _intracellular_ state of a cell, there are no physical transport terms (material is not flowing or from the cell). Intracellular balances in industrial metabolic engineering applications for liquid cultures are typically written in _biomass-specific units_, e.g., something per gram dry weight (gDW) of cells in the reactor; concentrations are given in units of $\star$-mol/gDW. In this case, the 
abstract volume basis $\beta$ is given by:

$$\beta = XV_{R}$$

where $X$ denotes the _dry_ cell mass per liter in the culture (units: gDW/L) and $V_{R}$ denotes the liquid volume of the culture. Substituting $\beta$ into general balance equation gives:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - 
\frac{C_{i}}{XV_{R}}\left(X\frac{dV_{R}}{dt}+V_{R}\frac{dX}{dt}\right)\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

Expanding the dilution terms gives:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - 
\frac{C_{i}}{V_{R}}\frac{dV_{R}}{dt}-\frac{C_{i}}{X}\frac{dX}{dt}\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

##### Continuous culture 

In continuous culture, material stream(s) are introduced in the reactor as some volumetric rate $F$ (units: L/hr) and removed at the same volumetric rate. Hence, there is no overall volume change in the reactor (volume flow rate in = volume flow rate out in). The cell mass balance equation for a continuous culture (assuming a sterile feed stream) is given by:

$$\frac{dX}{dt} = \left(\mu-D\right)X$$

where $\mu$ denotes the specific growth rate of the cells (units: hr$^{-1}$), and $D$ denotes the _dilution rate_ (units: hr$^{-1}$) which is defined as $D{\equiv}F/V_{R}$ (inverse of the residence time in the reactor). Substituting the cell mass time rate of change into the general species material balance gives:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - 
C_{i}\left(\mu - D\right)\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

At steady-state, all the time-derivatives vanish, and $\mu$=$D$. 
Thus the _intracellular metabolic state_ of the cell is governed by:

$$\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) = 0\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

In other words, what comes into the cell _must_ come out in some form. If we make metabolite _A_ (a node in the network), we must consume _A_ somehow (chemical reaction, or export _A_ out of the cell).

##### Batch culture 

In a batch culture, there is no liquid volume change ($dV_{R}/dt$ = 0). However, cell mass and products accumulate, and starting materials (substrates) decrease over time in the culture. Thus, the dilution terms become:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - {\mu}C_{i}\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

where $\mu$ denotes the _specific growth rate_ of the cells in the batch culture $\mu = X^{-1}\dot{X}$ (units: hr$^{-1}$). There is never an _extracellular_ steady-state in a batch culture, however, inside the cell in certain time windows (typically when $\mu\simeq\mu_{g}^{max}$) there is a pseudo-steady-state called _balanced growth_ in which all intracellular quantities are time-invariant leading to the condition:

$$\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right)-{\mu}C_{i} = 0\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

##### Fed-batch culture 

The volume is not constant in a fed-batch reactor because there is an input stream(s) but no output stream. Thus, the culture volume increases over time. Suppose we have a sterile feed stream (no cells coming into the reactor), and the reactor is fed at the volumetric flow rate $F$ (units: L/hr). Then the cell mass balance is given by:

$$\frac{dX}{dt} = \left(\mu-D\right)X$$

which at first glance appears to be the same as the continuous culture case, however unlike a chemostat (continuous culture), the dilution rate $D$ in a fed-batch reactor is a function of time, and no external steady-state is possible. Substituting the cell mass time rate of change into the general species material balance gives:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - DC_{i} -
C_{i}\left(\mu - D\right)\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

which after combining the dilution terms terms becomes:

$$\frac{dC_{i}}{dt} = \left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) - \mu{C_{i}}\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

While no _extracelluar_ steady-state is possible, under the _balanced growth_ hypothesis the intracellular state is governed by:

$$\left(\sum_{j=1}^{\mathcal{R}}\sigma_{ij}\hat{r}_{j}\right) -
\mu{C_{i}} = 0\qquad{i=1,\dots,\mathcal{M}}$$

which is the same form as the _batch_ culture.

##### Logical and Physical Control Volumes
One of the critical ideas of the constraint-based approach is the decomposition of (potentially) dynamic problems into a sequence of steady-state or pseudo-steady-state subproblems, which give snapshots of the flow through a metabolic network (in this world called _flux_). 

The mental model that makes this decomposition possible relies on partitioning variables into physical and _logical_ control volumes. In the constraint-based world, systems inside a logical control volume are at a steady state. Let's take a look at an example to make this clear.

Consider a batch reactor where we supply cells $X$, and the starting materials $A_{1x}$ and $A_{2x}$ in the media. In this case, the physical control could be the volume of the culture in the reactor, and the logical control volume could be the intracellular compartment of the cells in the reactor. 

Under this model, $A_{\star{x}}$, $P_{x}$ and $C_{x}$ would be _extracellular_ variables governed by _dynamic_ material balances, while all the intracellular species would be at steady-state. However, this obvious partition illustrates a significant _perceived_ shortcoming of the constraint-based approach; constraint-based tools can only be used to model/design systems at steady-state. __However, this is not true__. 

Let's consider a different scenario. Suppose the physical control volume is a cell with some volume basis $\beta$, while the logical control volume was some local section of the metabolic network in the cell. Under this scenario, 
$A_{\star{x}}$, $P_{x}$ and $C_{x}$ would be governed by _dynamic_ material balances (as before), but $A_{\star}$, B, C, x and y become _hypothetical local logical variables_ that are at steady-state. The _logical_ transport terms describe transport into/from the logical control volume. For example, suppose we partition the total amount of $A_{1, T}$ (what we would measure in the cell) into $A_{1x}$ and $A_{1}$. Let's write balances around $A_{1x}$ and $A_{1}$:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dA_{1x}}{dt} &=& -\frac{\dot{n}_{4}}{\beta} - \frac{A_{1x}}{\beta}\frac{d\beta}{dt}\\
\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} &=& \frac{\dot{n}_{4}}{\beta} - \hat{r}_{1} - \frac{A_{1}}{\beta}\frac{d\beta}{dt}
\end{eqnarray}$$

Adding the $A_{1x}$ and $A_{1}$ balances (to compute the time rate of change of the total amount to $A_{1}$) gives:

$$\frac{dA_{1x}}{dt}+\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = - \hat{r}_{1} - (A_{1x} + A_{1})\beta^{-1}\dot{\beta}$$

We know that the total amount of $A_{1,T}$ (what we would actually measure in the cell) is the sum of the two types of $A_{1}$: $A_{1,T} = A_{1x}+A_{1}$. Thus, differentiating $A_{1,T}$ with respect to time gives:

$$\frac{dA_{1,T}}{dt} = \frac{dA_{1x}}{dt} + \frac{dA_{1}}{dt}$$

Putting everything together gives:

$$\frac{dA_{1,T}}{dt} = - \hat{r}_{1} - \frac{A_{1,T}}{\beta}\frac{d\beta}{dt}$$

Thus, constraint-based tools can model dynamics; however, they do so in a sequence of discrete pseudo-steady-state snapshots.

##### Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical modeling and analysis approach that estimates the _intracellular_ reaction rate (metabolic flux) of carbon and energy throughout a metabolic network (units: $\star$mol/gDW-time or $\star$mol/L-time for cell-free networks). FBA arguably the most widely used tool in this space. However, there are alternatives to FBA, such as metabolic flux analysis (MFA), but these alternatives vary more in the solution approach than the structure of the estimation problem. 

Let's look at the following reference to understand better the different components of a flux balance analysis problem:

* [Orth, J., Thiele, I. & Palsson, B. What is flux balance analysis?. Nat Biotechnol 28, 245–248 (2010). https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1614](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC3108565/)

Computational tools for working with flux balance analysis models:

* [Heirendt, Laurent et al. "Creation and analysis of biochemical constraint-based models using the COBRA Toolbox v.3.0." Nature protocols vol. 14,3 (2019): 639-702. doi:10.1038/s41596-018-0098-2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30787451/)

###### Flux balance analysis problem structure
The FBA problem is typically encoded as a linear programming (LP) problem of the form:

$$\max_{v}\sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{R}}c_{i}v_{i}$$

subject to the constraints:

$$\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v} &=& \mathbf{0}\\
\mathcal{L}\leq&\mathbf{v}&\leq\mathcal{U}\\
\dots &=& \dots
\end{eqnarray}$$

where $\mathbf{S}$ denotes the stoichiometric matrix, $c_{i}$ denote the objective coefficients, 
$\mathbf{v}$ denotes the metabolic flux (the unknown that we are trying to estimate), and 
$\mathcal{L}$ ($\mathcal{U}$) denote the permissible lower (upper) bounds on the _unkown_ metabolic flux. The first set of constraints enforces conservation of mass, while the second imparts thermodynamic and kinetic information into the calculation. Finally, there are potentially other types of constraints (both linear and nonlinear) used in this type of problem (we will not cover these here, but these additional constraints may be important in specific applications that we see later).

### Formulation and properties of the stoichiometric matrix S
The stoichiometric matrix $\mathbf{S}$ is a $\mathcal{M}\times\mathcal{R}$ array holding the 
coefficients $\sigma_{ij}$; each row of $\mathbf{S}$ describes a metabolite, while each column represents a possible chemical reaction. Thus, the stoichiometric matrix is a _digital_ representation of the biochemical capabilities of a metabolic network. 

When formulating the stoichiometric matrix, what should be included to describe known or unknown desired phenomena? For example, suppose we are interested in producing product $P$ or making sense of a metabolic data set. Should every possible reaction or just some _subset_ of all possible reactions be included in the stoichiometric matrix? The practical significance of this question is two-fold:

* Fewer material balances are better when describing the behavior of a metabolic network, and
* Fewer chemical reactions (fluxes) result in less uncertainty when estimating the kinetic rates $\hat{r}_{j}$ (bounds) or other constraints.

Is there a systematic approach to systematically estimating all possible steady-state pathways through a metabolic network?

##### Convex pathway analysis

Convex pathway analysis is an approach to catalog all possible steady-state pathways through a metabolic network. In particular, convex decomposition approaches posit that any potential steady-state flux can be represented as the [convex combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_combination) of a set of [convex independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_position) basis vectors called _extreme pathways_ $\mathbf{P}_{i}$:

$$\mathbf{v} = \sum_{i=1}^{\mathcal{P}}\alpha_{i}\mathbf{P}_{i}$$

where $\mathcal{P}$ denotes the number of basis pathways, and $\mathbf{P}_{i}$ denotes the $\mathcal{R}\times{1}$ extreme pathway basis vector. The term(s) $\alpha_{i}\geq{0}$ denotes the weight of extreme pathway $i$.

Extreme pathways are _very difficult_ to compute but can give super exciting insights into the operation and capabilities of a metabolic network.
